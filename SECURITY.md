## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security related issues, please email [andrei.badea@varbox.io](mailto:andrei.badea@varbox.io) instead of using the issue tracker.

## Past Vulnerabilities

Since its inception in 2020, Varbox has had zero security breaches or reported security issues. 
However, its dependencies have had security flaws discovered and fixed - even major ones like Laravel, Bootstrap and jQuery. 
That's why it's a good idea for any project to be reasonably up-to-date. 
If we consider a security issue is something that affects our users, we'll email you.
