## Version Compatibility

| Varbox Version    | Laravel Version |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| `1.x`             | `7.x`           |
| `2.x`             | `8.x`           |

## Versioning Scheme

Varbox follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We're trying to release major platform releases as soon as a new Laravel version is released, but that's also dependable on the [third-party packages](https://varbox.io/docs/third-party-tools) the platform uses. Minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover any security related issues, please email [andrei.badea@varbox.io](mailto:andrei.badea@varbox.io) instead of using the issue tracker.
