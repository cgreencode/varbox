# Proprietary License

Permission is hereby granted to any person obtaining (A) a copy of this software and (B) a license code issued on [varbox.io](https://varbox.io) (the "Software"/"Varbox" and "License" respectively), to use the software in production environments (on servers with addresses reachable by public DNS, public IP addresses or commercial private networks). This includes the rights to use, copy and / or modify the Software or copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions in this document.

This license does not include the rights to publicly or privately sublicense or publish this Software, its copies or any derivations, with or without the purpose of commercial profit. Different licenses are required for copies, third-party packages and derivations of the software, detailed in the articles below.

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with Varbox or the use or other dealings in the Software.

The sole copyright holder and author of the Software is Andrei Badea [andrei.badea@varbox.io](mailto:andrei.badea@varbox.io). Any code contributions made to Varbox by third parties, be it individuals or companies, are considered a gesture of good will, and become the property of the copyright holder as soon as they are submitted. The contributors keep the right to use, copy, modify, promote and release the portions of the Software they have contributed, but so does the copyright holder.

This copyright notice and permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The current license has been last modified on 28.07.2020, and is mandatory for any usage of versions of Varbox (commonly referred to as "releases" or "tags").

### Free for use on localhost

Should Varbox be used in a development environment, without being presented to clients or final users, no financial reward is expected and the above rights (Article 1) are given FREE OF CHARGE in that environment. When the application is not available under a public DNS address or public IP address, and no money has been made from using Varbox, **no license code is required**.

### Paid for use outside localhost

We consider it commercial use when anybody involved in the project that uses Varbox makes money. If anybody (including but not limited to: the developer, employer, employees or clients) using Varbox inside a project (by building, maintaining, leasing, renting, selling or reselling the project) is financially rewarded directly (wage, commission, subscription, advertising)or indirectly(by reducing costs or increasing efficiency in a commercial endeavour), it is considered commercial use. Any usage by a commercial entity is considered commercial use. Internal usage by a commercial entity is considered commercial use.

Should Varbox be used for commercial purposes, the user is required to purchase a license code on [varbox.io](https://varbox.io/buy) for each domain name this sofware will be used on, before its usage in production. Alternatively, the user can [apply for volume discounts or a commercial license for unlimited projects](https://varbox.test/discount). Failure to do so will constitute as illegal commercial use.

Should Varbox be included in Software-as-a-Service product, a [commercial license for unlimited projects](https://varbox.test/discount) is required, which can be applied for.

By using Varbox in production without a valid license code for that project, issued by the copyright holder, the user is considered to be breaching the terms of the current license, and agrees to be subject to punishments including but not limited to:
- having his administration panel stop working, interrupted, disabled or removed;
- being removed or banned from the Varbox community;
- being publicly disclosed as untrustworthy, in a "Wall of Shame" section, on partner websites, on social networks like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, or any other way the copyright holder sees fit;

The copyright holder will attempt to contact the user 7 days before punitive action is taken if contact information is easily available, but is not obligated to do so. The user who has committed a breach of license terms can only purchase a special "Redemption License", issued individually, priced at 10 to 1000 times the list price, depending on the gravity of the breach and estimated foregone earnings. The price of the "Redemption License" is to be decided by the copyright holder on a case-by-case basis. Contact [office@varbox.io](mailto:office@varbox.io) if you've found you're breaching the terms - special consideration is given to those who report themselves.
